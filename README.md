# Network of collaborations in r/Place 2022

![plot](assets/img/pic.png)


## Description
I thought that it would have been really cool to study and try to visualize the interaction between contributors of Reddit Place 2022 event. If you don't know what it is: [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) or [timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O3UgLG2Jw).

I took a network science course titled "Complexity in social systems" and decided to bring this work as final project and it was really appreciated (or maybe I just have been lucky to have the professor nerdy enough to appreciate it).
